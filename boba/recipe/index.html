<h2>Recipe for boba</h2>
<p>Brown Sugar Tapioca Boba Recipe (Restaurant Style)
Ingredients</p>
<h3>Ingridients</h3>
<h4>For the pearls</h4>
<ul type = circle>
<li>1 cup tapioca starch (do not substitute with cornstarch or wheat flour)</li>
<li>½ cup boiling water</li>
<li>2 tbsp dark brown sugar (or muscovado sugar for richer flavor)</li>
</ul>
<h4>For the brown sugar syrup</h4>
<ul type="circle">
    <li>1 cup dark brown sugar</li>
    <li>½ cup water</li>
</ul>
<h3>Instructions</h3>
<dl>
    <dt><strong>Preparing the Dough</strong></dt>
    <dd>Start by placing 1 cup of tapioca starch in a heatproof bowl. Boil ½ cup of water and pour it into the starch while stirring quickly. Add 2 tablespoons of dark brown sugar and mix until a dough forms. Knead the dough until it is smooth and easy to handle.</dd>
    <br>
    <dt><strong>Shaping the Pearls</strong></dt>
    <dd>Roll the dough into thin logs about the size of a pencil. Cut the logs into small pieces, then roll each piece into a marble-sized ball. Dust the pearls lightly with extra tapioca starch to stop them from sticking.</dd>
   <br>
    <dt><strong>Cooking the Pearls</strong></dt>
    <dd>Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Add the pearls and stir gently to prevent sticking. Boil the pearls for 15 to 20 minutes until they become chewy. Turn off the heat and let the pearls sit covered in hot water for 5 minutes. Drain and rinse with cold water.</dd>
   <br>
    <dt><strong>Combining Pearls and Syrup</strong></dt>
    <dd>Add the cooked pearls to the syrup and cook for another 2 to 3 minutes. This helps the pearls absorb the syrup’s rich flavor.</dd>
<br>
    <dt><strong>Serving</strong></dt>
<dd>Serve the warm, syrup-coated pearls in your favorite drink, such as milk tea or fresh milk. Use a wide straw to enjoy the chewy texture with every sip.</dd>
